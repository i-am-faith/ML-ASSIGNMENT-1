5. **Use in Model Building**
    ```python
    # Your model building code here
    ```
6. **Standardize Input**
    ```python
    X = (X - X.mean()) / (X.std())
    ```
    ⚠️ **Important:** Standardize your input to prevent explosions!
    
7. **Answer the Following Questions**

## Additional Tips

- Make sure to explore and visualize your data using `matplotlib`.
